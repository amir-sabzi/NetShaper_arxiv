\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

{\sys} is a provably secure network side-channel mitigation system that provides
quantifiable and tunable privacy guarantees in traffic shaping.
\todo{We believe that {\sys} can eliminate the arms race in {\nsca} attacks and
defenses and can provide a portable and configurable framework for deploying
mitigations for applications with diverse traffic characteristics and in
different settings.}
{\sys}'s DP based traffic shaping strategy as well as its
modular and portable tunnel design can be extended to mitigate leaks
in multi-node systems, but we leave the details to future work.
